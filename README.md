+ **Deep Learning** Model Integration: Seamless implementation of state-of-the-art deep learning models for enhanced image focusing and noise reduction.
+ **Sentinel-1** Data Support: Comprehensive support for the ingestion and processing of raw Sentinel-1 data.
+ **Range-Doppler Algorithm**: Efficient and precise focusing of SAR images through the implementation of the Range-Doppler algorithm.
+ **Parallel Processing**: Accelerated data processing utilizing parallel computing capabilities to handle large datasets.
+ **Geospatial Output**: Geocoded image output support in commonly used formats, such as GeoTIFF, for seamless integration with GIS software.
+ **Modular Design**: A modular and user-friendly design allowing for easy customization and extension of the library.

## Installation


To install SARLens, simply use the following pip command:

```
source installer/install.sh
```

## Usage

To utilize SARLens for decoding and focusing raw Sentinel-1 SAR images, follow these steps:

Import the necessary SARLens modules:

```
from SARLens.SARProcessor.Focus import RD
import sentinel1decoder
import sentinel1decoder.constants
import sentinel1decoder.utilities

# Create decoder
decoder = sentinel1decoder.Level0Decoder(input_file, g_level=logging.WARNING)
df = decoder.decode_metadata()
df[df["Swath Number"] == swath_number]
ephemeris = sentinel1decoder.utilities.read_subcommed_data(df)

selection = df.iloc[1000:2000] 
RangeDoppler = RD(decoder, selection, ephemeris)
logging.info(f"selected {RangeDoppler.selection.shape[0]} lines")
# Process the raw data using the Range-Doppler algorithm:
RangeDoppler.process()
print("Done")

# TODO:
focused_image = processor.range_doppler(raw_data)
Save the focused image in GeoTIFF format:
focused_image.save("path/to/output/focused_image.tif")
```
